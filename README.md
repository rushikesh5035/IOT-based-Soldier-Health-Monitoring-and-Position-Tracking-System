# IOT-based-Soldier-Health-Monitoring-and-Position-Tracking-System

**Introduction**
  The IoT-based Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance the overall well-being and operational effectiveness of military personnel. This system integrates advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to continuously monitor the health parameters of soldiers in real-time, as well as track their positions during various missions and operations.

**Problem Statement**
  Traditional methods of monitoring soldier health and tracking their positions often rely on manual reporting or periodic check-ins. The delay in identifying health issues and the lack of real-time, accurate position tracking can compromise the safety and success of military operations. The proposed system addresses the following challenges:
  1) Delayed Health Monitoring
  2) Inaccurate Position Tracking
  3) Communication Challenges

**Proposed Solution**
  The IoT-based Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System utilizes advanced sensors and communication technologies to address the identified challenges:
  1) Health Monitoring: Temperature Sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Oxygen Level Sensor.
  2) Position Tracking: GPS (Global Positioning System).
  3) Communication Enhancement:GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and Wi-Fi Module.
