# IOT-based-Soldier-Health-Monitoring-and-Position-Tracking-System

**Introduction :**

The IoT-based Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance the overall well-being and operational effectiveness of military personnel. This system integrates advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to continuously monitor the health parameters of soldiers in real-time, as well as track their positions during various missions and operations.

**Problem Statement :**

Traditional methods of monitoring soldier health and tracking their positions often rely on manual reporting or periodic check-ins. The delay in identifying health issues and the lack of real-time, accurate position tracking can compromise the safety and success of military operations. The proposed system addresses the following challenges:
  1) Delayed Health Monitoring
  2) Inaccurate Position Tracking
  3) Communication Challenges

**Proposed Solution :**

The IoT-based Soldier Health Monitoring and Position Tracking System utilizes advanced sensors and communication technologies to address the identified challenges:
  1) Health Monitoring: Temperature Sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Oxygen Level Sensor.
  2) Position Tracking: GPS (Global Positioning System).
  3) Communication Enhancement: GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and Wi-Fi Module.

**Hardware Requirement :**

  1)	ESP 32
  2)	Temperature Sensor (LM35)
  3)	Heart Rate & Oxygen Level Sensor (MAX30100)
  4)	GPS (NEO-6M)
  5)	GSM (SIM 900A)
  6)	LCD Display (16*2) 
  7)	Battery (12V)

**Software Requirement:**

  1)	Arduino IDE 
  2)	Proteus 
  3)	Thing-speak
